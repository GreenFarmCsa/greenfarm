*IBM : Call for Code 2021*

**Green Farm is a tech-for-good, green and digital solution based on CSA which promotes the green agricultural production for small farmers, provides responsible produce for consumers. It is available for download on Apple Store.**


## The Problem

In a study co-authored by FAO, it points out food systems account for over one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions and two-thirds of food system emissions come from agriculture, land use and changes in land use. Sustainable farming plays an important role in helping reducing carbon emissions and combat climate change, however, it still makes up a small share of farming practice. For small farmers, their planting methods are usually neither low-carbon nor sustainable. It is difficult for them to try alternative methods because of easy susceptible to weather change, financial risks and unstable customer demands. For consumers, during COVID-19 pandemic, they have participated in CSA farms to get clean, fresh food delivered to doors.However, a large number of new local CSA farms emerged lately, they concern about the quality standards of these produce and whether the production process is green.   


## Green Farm

Green Farm aims to tackle these issues. It is a tech-for-good, green and digital solution based on CSA(Community Supported Agriculture). It is committed to motivating green agricultural production and sustainable living.   
Green Farm iOS app has been released. Farmers can use this app to register the farm, add lands(support CSA subscriptions or lease), plant crops sustainably, track and record all steps of crops, sell produce on Green Farm mall, manage and check their green planting progress, farm map, carbon footprint behavior , and integrated carbon curve, etc. Consumers can use this app to find CSA farms nearby, subscribe to the CSA box, rent lands, buy produce , join communities and write posts and comments, etc.

## Competitiveness

Green Farm is currently the only green and digital CSA solution to help small farmers and consumers to develop green, sustainable planting practice and low-carbon consumption behavior.
Our advantages are as follows: 
Completeness and transferability: Our app fully implements the digital farm and achieves complete functions including land lease, green planting and carbon footprint calculation to help farmers all the way from production to sales. The app has been piloted on farms in Beijing and can also be introduced to other regions of the world.
Effectiveness and efficiency: The app effectively helps small farmers and consumers with the problem of responsible production and consumption, and can also be expanded to food safety, e-commerce and other fields.
Design and usability: The app uses AR, VR, live streaming and other technologies to bring a good user experience. It is available for download and use on App Store from all over the world.
Creativity and innovation: Through live streaming,blockchain and federated learning, the problem of untraceable planting processes is solved, and a scheme for trusted planting and consumption of produce is provided.


## Vision

We aim to introduce Green Farm to more regions around the world to help more small farmers practice low-carbon planting, increase their income, and make the farms more digital, sustainable and responsible. It will also match more consumers with suitable CSA farms, allowing consumers to eat green and fresh produce, and continue to practice a low-carbon lifestyle. In the future, we are committed to becoming a global popular carbon neutral app in agriculture.
