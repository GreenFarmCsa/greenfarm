# Green Farm - A green and digital CSA solution

*IBM : Call for Code 2021*

**Green Farm is a tech-for-good, green and digital solution based on CSA which promotes the green agricultural production for small farmers, provides responsible produce for consumers. It is available for download on Apple Store.**


## The Problem

Food safety issues have become common nowadays. According to the 2020 FAO report, nearly 750 million people in the world have been affected by food insecurity. In addition, The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown made it difficult for consumers to go to grocery stores every week. For safety considerations, many consumers have participated in CSA farms to get clean, fresh and credible food.  

Lately, a large number of new local CSA farms emerged, thus people began to concern about the quality standards of these produce and whether the production process is green. 

Small farmers have few customers, their income is unstable and they have poor ability to resist financial risks. They care more about how to retain and attract more customers. They want to lease their lands which can increase their income, limit financial risk, benefit the environment and sustainable development of the farms. 
 
The 2nd and the 12th goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations is "achieve food security, promote sustainable agriculture, ensure responsible consumption and production". Based on the SDGs, Call for Code 2021 Global Challenge calls for taking immediate actions to combat climate change.  


## The Introduction of our solution

In support of these goals and to solve problems of farmers and consumers , we build Green Farm, **a tech-for-good, green and digital solution based on CSA(Community Supported Agriculture)**.  Green Farm devotes to motivating **green agricultural production and sustainable living**. It is composed of **One Farm, One Map and One Account**.

**One Farm is a digital twin farm**. It uses live streaming to connect producers and consumers in real-time, AR（Augmented Reality）and VR(Virtual Realtiy) to make you feel in the middle of farms, IBM Waston to perform efficient matching and recommendations, IBM Blockchain to ensure the credibility and traceability of the planting data. Thus it helps develop trusted, digital and intelligent green agricultural production. 

**One Map** aggregates farm production activities on the global map, enabling consumers from different countries at multiple areas to efficiently find CSA farms nearby and get fresh produce.

**One Account** is a carbon credit account and records farmers’ low-carbon production and consumption activities. Green Farm sets up a federated learning network with different financial institutions involved. After being authorized, they will provide you with targeted financial support based on One Account.

Green Farm is a iOS App,which mainly includes the following features:

**1. Farm.** Farmers can register the farm, including the name of the farm, introduction, VR photos, supported crops and other information. Green Farm supports farm retrieval by map, crop, farm area, and more.

**2. Land.** Farmers can add land to their farms, and land supports CSA subscriptions or leases.

**3. Planting.** Farmers or land renters can track and record all steps of crops (seed, fertilization, irrigation, weeding and harvesting,upload planting pictures and videos), and support live streaming to show their planting behaviors.

**4. Produce.** Support the shelving of produce after harvest, and support the browsing, purchasing and evaluation of produce.

**5. Community.** People who join the same CSA farm can communicate with post and comment on the community and share green planting and consumption information.

**6. Activities.** Activities can display the current user's planting activity progress, carbon integral curve, recommended farms and produce.

**7. Me.** This feature shall provide unified management of my green planting, farm map, carbon footprint behavior (carbon credits corresponding to planting activities, but not real carbon footprint), CSA farms you joined, produce you purchased, and green financial products (simulated, not real).

## Competitiveness

Green Farm is the only green and digital CSA solution to help small farmers and consumers to develop green, sustainable planting and low-carbon consumption in an interesting, real-time, and interactive way.  We use federal learning algorithm to do a lot of work and recommend the most suitable farm, produce and financial products to farmers and consumers.  Although there are many apps providing carbon footprint and carbon offset functions, but there is no platform for small farmers and consumers to provide green ,sustainable planting and consumption.


## Vision

We aim to provide a green , sustainable and digital platform for global small farmers and consumers, share global green agricultural practices, and form a good atmosphere of green life around the world.
